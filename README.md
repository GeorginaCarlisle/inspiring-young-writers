## Design

### The Strategy Plane

#### Target User Group

Children who can write and specifically children aged 8 – 12.

They can:

- Use a keyboard to type.
- Spell words, put together sentences and build a larger piece of writing.
- Articulate simple concepts or ideas through the written word.

However, they are still developing the skills needed to:

- Articulate clearly more complex thoughts, ideas and concepts through the written word.
- Write for the reader and include details that will allow the reader to fully understand the story/concept etc.
- Build narratives that flow, with the story they are telling working together as a whole.

#### Problem Background

Becoming an articulate writer and being able to tell a story (whether fiction or non-fiction) for an audience is a complex skill that takes time and practice to master. As with any skill, it is practice, exposure and feedback that leads to progress.

Primary schools do an amazing job of helping children to progress with their writing. However, while children get plenty of chance to practice writing at school, their writing is usually accompanied by restriction (a theme, writing style, time limit, particular language construct to be focused on) and even the environment of a classroom can provide further restriction.

Where then can children build in this practice of writing for an audience in a less restricted way? Where can they share their writing and gain feedback, motivation, inspiration, and exposure to stories written by those at a similar skill level to them?

There are plenty of writing competitions for children and magazines where they can send stories. However, these again often come with restrictions (theme, word count, deadline) and often don’t lend themselves to a child being able to continually share new stores and quickly gain feedback.

#### Problem Statement

“I am a child who has the potential to become a fantastic writer, however a lack of opportunity to share and gain feedback from writing created purely for pleasure means I have less motivation and reason to write. I therefore write less and gain less feedback which ultimately means my progression is less than it could be.”

#### Project Aim

This project aims to provide children aged 8 - 12 with a safe space where they can share their writing - created for pleasure without restriction - and gain feedback.

#### Safety Considerations

As this project is aimed at children, extra thought needs to be given to making sure the space provided for them to share their writing in is safe.

Two main areas of danger will be considered throughout this project:

- The danger of children being exposed to material or comments that are inappropriate or may cause harm.
- The danger of someone being able to contact and connect with a child (whether in the space or outside via the gaining of contact information) which then leaves them vulnerable to abuse.

### The Skeleton Plane

The following wire frames show the intended design for the platform on both mobile and desktop.

The platform will be split into two distinction sections:

- New User Experience (the part of the platform that can be accessed without logging in)
- Authenticated User Experience (this will be unique to each registered user and can only be accessed by logging in)

#### New User Experience

This section of the platform can be accessed by anyone and will consist of four pages and one modal. Each page will build on the same base template and will share the same header, hero image, footer and background.

<details>
<summary>
Landing Page
</summary>

The main url will direct straight to the landing page.

![Wireframe showing the intended design of the landing page](documentation/design/wireframes/wireframe-landing-page.png)

Notes: The landing page can be re-accessed by clicking on the platform name in the top left corner. The sign-up today section will also contain details about the ability to give and recieve feedback, should this feature be implemented.

</details>

<summary>
Contact
</summary>

This page provides parents of new users with a means of contacting the site admin.

![Wireframe showing the intended design of the contact page](documentation/design/wireframes/wireframe-contact.png)

Notes: Feedback will be provided to the user if any of the form input fields fail to pass validation. Feedback to the user will also be provided on successful submission of the form.

</details>

<details>
<summary>
Sign-up
</summary>

This page provides new users alongside their parents with the means to register for the platform and create an account.

![Wireframe showing the intended design of the sign-up page](documentation/design/wireframes/wireframe-signup.png)

</summary>

This page provides registered users with the means to login to their account.

![Wireframe showing the intended design of the login page](documentation/design/wireframes/wireframe-login.png)

Notes: Feedback will be provided to the user if any of the form input fields fail to link to a known account. Feedback to the user will also be provided on successful user authentication prior to redirection to their account home page.

</details>

<details>
<summary>
Parent Information Modal
</summary>

This part of the platform provides parents with all the information they should need. It has been created as a modal, so that it can be viewed during the sign-up process (as well as independently as shown here) without the user needing to come away from the sign-up form.

![Wireframe showing the intended design of the parent information modal](documentation/design/wireframes/wireframe-parents.png)

Notes: In the above view the modal is shown as accessed from the landing page.

</details>

#### Authenticated User Experience

This section of the platform can only be accessed by a registered user logging into their account and will allow them to access to their work as well as published work. It will consist of six pages. Each page will build on the same base template and will share the same header, footer and background. Two of these pages will also contain a number of changing modals.

<details>
<summary>
Account Home
</summary>

This is the page a user will be directed to when they first log in.

### The Surface Plane

#### Typography

Three different fonts have been chosen for the platform to provide extra distinctness to text used for different purposes. All the fonts are sans serif to make for clear text that is easy to read and share some common themes so that they work well together. All fonts have been sourced from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com).

##### Headings

The font **Boogaloo** by [John Vargas Beltran](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Boogaloo?preview.text=Inspiring%20Young%20Writers&classification=Display&stroke=Sans+Serif) has been chosen for all the headings across the site. It has a more organic feel with clear character while still being clear and easy to read.

![Example of the Boogaloo font with the text "Inspiring Young Writers"](documentation/design/typography-boogaloo.png)

##### Main platform text

The font **Ubuntu** by [Dalton Maag](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Ubuntu?preview.text=View%20Feedback&stroke=Sans+Serif) has been chosen for all the main text on the platform. It is the most uniform of the three texts, while still showing a little organic character.

![Example of the Ubuntu font with the text "Write and share stories"](documentation/design/typography-ubuntu.png)

##### Children's work text

A third font has been chosen so that any text generated by the users, such as their work and feedback, stands out against the main platform text. The font **Ubuntu Mono** by [Dalton Maag](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Ubuntu+Mono) has been chosen for this purpose. It is more akin to handwritten text, while still maintaining a clearness and uniformity which will be important during it's use for large blocks of text.

![Example of the Ubuntu Mono font with the text "Once upon a time"](documentation/design/typography-ubuntu-mono.png)

#### Colour Scheme

Three key thoughts inspired the chosen colour scheme:

1 - Children's websites and apps tend to use bold colours. By then using bold colours for this platform it helps it to stand out as being for children.

2 - The colour scheme should be linked with creativity, imagination and positivity. The following article [Colors that inspire creativity](https://www.innovation-creativity.com/colors-that-inspire-creativity/) suggested that the core colors that inspire creativity are thought to be orange and yellow. With orange being said to inspire creativity and enthusiasm and yellow to inspire creativity, imagination, and inspiration.

3 - All text should provide a high contrast to the background and meet accessibility guidelines.

![An image showing the four main colours, all details in the image are provided below](documentation/design/colour-scheme.png)

Four background colours have been chosen:

- A very light zinc gray #FAFAFA (250, 250, 250)
- A lighter yellowy orange #F6BD58 (246, 189, 88)
- An orange #EA580C (234, 88, 12)
- A dark blue #1E3A8A (30 58 138);

With three text colours:

- Black #000000 for all the main text
- Orange #EA580C (234, 88, 12) for the main titles
- A darker orange #C2410C (194, 65, 12) for titles with a smaller font weight and size.

##### Colour contrast

The following images show the contrast between the text and background across the platform.

![The contrast of black text on a light zinc gray background passes all criteria](documentation/design/color-contrast-black-on-zinc.png)

![The contrast of black text on a light orange background passes all criteria](documentation/design/colour-contrast-black-on-l-orange.png)

![The contrast of black text on a light zinc gray background passes all but the AAA for normal text](documentation/design/colour-contrast-black-on-orange.png)

![The contrast of orange text on a light zinc gray background only passes the AA criteria for large text](documentation/design/colour-contrast-orange-on-zinc.png)
It is to be noted that the above text colour will only be used with this background for very large text. Where the text is smaller (but still larger than avergae) the colour documented below will be used.

## Agile Methodology

Agile values and principles have been followed in the creation of this project where they fit into a solo project built purely for educational purposes.

In particular the following common Agile practices have been followed:
user stories, story points and team velocity, product backlog, time boxing, prioritization and information radiators.

### User Stories

Please see the [Scope Plane](#the-scope-plane) for the user stories created for this project which breakdown the Epics detailing the main features of the platform into manageable chunks of work.

The issues tool on GitHub has been used to record all user stories. Acceptance criteria and tasks were added to the user stories as the project progressed.

### Story Points and Team Velocity

Story Points were used as a way to judge how long a user story might take to complete. With an estimated team velocity used to judge how many story points may beable to be completed per iteration and therefore which user stories to add to the next iteration.

In order to judge story points the following user story was used as the base guide and given a value of **2 story points**:

> 3 - As a new user I am given clear information on what registered users can do, so that I know what signing up will allow me to see and do.

I chose this user story to base the story points on, as I felt it represent a fairly short and familiar task.

A Doubling score was then used when estimating story points for other user stories, with familiarity of the coding needed to complete the user story also taken into account. Story points were also re-assessed at the beginning of each new iteration in light of work already completed and my increasing confidence and familiarity with Django.

Story points were recorded using labels attached to the user story.

An initial team velocity was set as **40 story points a week**. Note that the 4 iterations will each be a week long.

### Product Backlog

A product backlog was used in which to store all user stories, prior to being assigned into an iteration. Any user stories not completed at the end of the iteration were then moved back into the backlog. At the end of the project a number of user stories remained in the product backlog. These have been discussed in the [future features](#future-features) section of the readme.

The product backlog is visible on GitHub through the use of a milestone titled "Backlog" and a specific backlog column in the project board.

### Time Boxing

Developement of the project was split into four time boxes/iterations. Each iteration was set to a period of one week.

#### First Iteration

<details>
<summary>

</summary>

During the first iteration the following user stories and key tasks were completed and closed:
![Screen shot of the First iteration milestone showing closed issues - User stories 1, 7 and 64 plus key additional tasks](documentation/agile/first-iteration-closed.png)

At the end of the iteration the following user stories remained un-completed and open:
![Screen shot of the First iteration milestone showing open issues - User stories 5, 8, 9, 10, 11 and 17](documentation/agile/first-iteration-open.png)

It is to be noted that the:

- **Contact** user story (#5) had all tasks completed, however it failed manual testing with a bug and additional task identified. Both have been added into the backlog as issues.
- **Page link errors** (#8) user story cannot be fully completed until authorisation is in place.
- **Contact form data passed to Admin** (#6) user story despite not being part of this iteration has also been partially completed.

</details>

#### Second Iteration

#### Third Iteration

#### Fourth Iteration

### MoSCoW Prioritisation

MoSCoW prioritisation was used throughout the project. At the beginning of each new iteration the project backlog was accessed and each user story categorised for the current iteration (not the project over all), thus allowing for the correct balance of prioritisation for each iteration. This process was repeated for each new iteration, being mindful at all times of the overall remaining project time left.

- **Must Have** the user stories deemed vital for this iteration of the project.

- **Should Have** the user stories deemed important but not vital for this iteration of the project.

- **Could Have** the user stories that will only have a small impact if left out of this iteration of the project.

- **Won't Have** the user stories that won't be worked on during this iteration of the project. These weren't speicifically labelled and were simply left in the backlog.

#### Extra notes on prioritisation

It is to be noted that:

- While solving a real world problem and being designed for the real world this project is being built for education purposes only.

- The nature of the project involving children has necessitated a large number of user stories geared around safety. All of which in the real world would need to be in place and therefore designated **Must Have**.

- Completing ALL of the user stories geared around safety is not a viable or necessary aim of this project, given that the real underlying purpose of this project is to showcase software development skills and it is current form won't be released as a real project for anyone to sign-up to and use.

Therefore it has been decided for this particular project that user stories geared around safety won't necessarily be prioritised as must haves. However, should any remain uncompleted at the end of the project a full explanation will be given.

## Bugs and Fixes

| # | Bug | What was tried | Fix |
| - | -- | ----- | --- |
| 1 | Tailwind CSS working locally, but not being served on the deployed site. | Research into Tailwind and Django. Research into Tailwind and Heroku. Tested different methods of installing Tailwind. Tried various fixes to deploy through Heroku. Went back to basics. Found advice from slack community around Heroku and static files. Worked back through changes, which changes were needed and which weren't. | Followed [Tailwind CSS Django - Flowbite](https://flowbite.com/docs/getting-started/django/) to install Tailwind with css files stored in best location. Set DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC to 0 on Heroku. Specific Deployment Branch with Debug to False and compress removed (base.html and settings.py). Run the command **./manage.py collectstatic** prior to deployment. |
| 2 | Contact form textarea automatically renders with 16 whitespace characters | This is the repeat of a bug from my first project and numerous google searching once again led to no answers. Problem inputted into ChatGPT which then located the error. | The way I had formatted the code with the close tag of the textarea element on the line below the open tag was leading to the error. Placing the close tag directly after the open tag resolved the error. |
| 3 | On contact form submission the following error displays: SMTP.starttls() got an unexpected keyword argument 'keyfile' | [Research](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/77482831/smtp-starttls-got-an-unexpected-keyword-argument-keyfile) found which I thought suggested Django version was the issue. Django updated causing postgresql to need updating which caused the project to fully cease working. Tutor support contacted and python version identified as root cause. | Python version updated to 3.9.17 |
| 4 | When working locally using VScode and trying to runserver I encountered the following error messages: 'python3(29793,0x70000e8e1000) malloc: *** error for object 0x82: pointer being freed was not allocated', 'python3(29793,0x70000e8e1000) malloc: *** set a breakpoint in malloc_error_break to debug' | Initial research led to suggestions about X-code, which I am unable to install on this laptop. Decision to move to using CodeAnywhere, where the project ran without issue. Then Daisy McGirr from CI's slack community suggested switching to use psycopg2-binary. Installing latest psycopg2-binary caused errors as it wasn't compatible with older postgresql. | Switched from Psycopg2 to Psycopg2-binary version 2.8.6 |
| 5 | When attempting to delete a user from the admin panel I faced the following error: IntegrityError at /admin/users/user/ insert or update on table "django_admin_log" violates foreign key constraint "django_admin_log_user_id_c564eba6_fk_auth_user_id" DETAIL: Key (user_id)=(4) is not present in table "auth_user". | I spent time exploring and gaining an understanding of the error using google searches and chatGPT. This led me to the belief that maybe the django_admin_log was built prior to me referencing my custom user model within settings.py and therefore when attempting to delete a user in the admin panel the admin_log can't find the details because it is looking in the wrong place (the default auth_user table). I then contacted Tutor support for guidance on how best to solve this issue. | |
